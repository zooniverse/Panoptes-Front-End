      summary: '## User Agreement\n**Summary**\n\nThe Zooniverse is a suite of citizen science projects operated by the Citizen Science Alliance (CSA), which support scientific research by involving members of the public - you - in the processes of analyzing and discussing data. Data from these projects is used to study online community design and theory, interface design, and other topics. This document describes what will happen to your contributions if you choose to contribute and what data we collect, how we use it and how we protect it.',
      contribution: '**What you agree to if you contribute to the Zooniverse**\n\nProjects involving the public are needed to enable researchers to cope with the otherwise unmanageable flood of data. The web provides a means of reaching a large audience willing to devote their free time to projects that can add to our knowledge of the world and the Universe.\n\nThe major goal for this project is for the analyzed data to be available to the researchers for use, modification and redistribution in order to further scientific research. Therefore, if you contribute to the Zooniverse, you grant the CSA and its collaborators, permission to use your contributions however we like to further this goal, trusting us to do the right thing with your data. However, you give us this permission non-exclusively, meaning that you yourself still own your contribution.\n\nWe ask you to grant us these broad permissions, because they allow us to change the legal details by which we keep the data available; this is important because the legal environment can change and we need to be able to respond without obtaining permission from every single contributor.\n\nFinally, you must not contribute data to the Zooniverse that you do not own. For example, do not copy information from published journal articles. If people do this, it can cause major legal headaches for us.',
      data: '**What you may do with Zooniverse data**\n\nYou retain ownership of any contribution you make to the Zooniverse, and any recorded interaction with the dataset associated with the Zooniverse. You may use, distribute or modify your individual contribution in any way you like. However, you do not possess ownership of the dataset itself. This license does not apply to data about you, covered in the Privacy Policy.',
      legal: '**Legal details**\n\nBy submitting your contribution to the Zooniverse, you agree to grant the CSA a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sub-licensable license to: use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and exercise all copyright and publicity rights with respect to your contribution worldwide and/or to incorporate your contribution in other works in any media now known or later developed for the full term of any rights that may exist in your contribution.\n\nIf you do not want to grant to the CSA the rights set out above, you cannot interact with the Zooniverse.\n\nBy interacting with the Zooniverse, you:\n\n* Warrant that your contribution contains only data that you have the right to make available to the CSA for all the purposes specified above, is not defamatory, and does not infringe any law; and\n\n* Indemnify the CSA against all legal fees, damages and other expenses that may be incurred by the CSA as a result of your breach of the above warranty; and\n\n* Waive any moral rights in your contribution for the purposes specified above.\n\nThis license does not apply to data about you, covered in the Privacy Policy.'

      whatIsZooniverse: 'The Zooniverse is the world’s largest and most popular platform for people-powered research. This research is made possible by volunteers — hundreds of thousands of people around the world who come together to assist professional researchers. Our goal is to enable research that would not be possible, or practical, otherwise. Zooniverse research results in new discoveries, datasets useful to the wider research community, and [many publications](/about/publications).',
      anyoneCanResearch: '### At the Zooniverse, anyone can be a researcher\n\nYou don’t need any specialised background, training, or expertise to participate in any Zooniverse projects. We make it easy for anyone to contribute to real academic research, on their own computer, at their own convenience.\n\nYou’ll be able to study authentic objects of interest gathered by researchers, like images of faraway galaxies, historical records and diaries, or videos of animals in their natural habitats. By answering simple questions about them, you’ll help contribute to our understanding of our world, our history, our Universe, and more.\n\nWith our wide-ranging and ever-expanding suite of projects, covering many disciplines and topics across the sciences and humanities, there\'s a place for anyone and everyone to explore, learn and have fun in the Zooniverse. To volunteer with us, just go to the [Projects](/projects) page, choose one you like the look of, and get started.',
      accelerateResearch: '### We accelerate important research by working together\n\nThe major challenge of 21st century research is dealing with the flood of information we can now collect about the world around us. Computers can help, but in many fields the human ability for pattern recognition — and our ability to be surprised — makes us superior. With the help of Zooniverse volunteers, researchers can analyze their information more quickly and accurately than would otherwise be possible, saving time and resources, advancing the ability of computers to do the same tasks, and leading to faster progress and understanding of the world, getting to exciting results more quickly.\n\nOur projects combine contributions from many individual volunteers, relying on a version of the ‘wisdom of crowds’ to produce reliable and accurate data. By having many people look at the data we often can also estimate how likely we are to make an error. The product of a Zooniverse projects is often exactly what’s needed to make progress in many fields of research.',
      discoveries: '### Volunteers and professionals make real discoveries together\n\nZooniverse projects are constructed with the aim of converting volunteers\' efforts into measurable results. These projects have produced a large number of [published research papers](/about/publications), as well as several open-source sets of analyzed data. In some cases, Zooniverse volunteers have even made completely unexpected and scientifically significant discoveries.\n\nA significant amount of this research takes place on the Zooniverse discussion boards, where volunteers can work together with each other and with the research teams. These boards are integrated with each project to allow for everything from quick hashtagging to in-depth collaborative analysis. There is also a central Zooniverse board for general chat and discussion about Zooniverse-wide matters.\n\nMany of the most interesting discoveries from Zooniverse projects have come from discussion between volunteers and researchers. We encourage all users to join the conversation on the discussion boards for more in-depth participation.'

      title: '### Frequently Asked Questions',
      whyNeedHelp: '- **Why do researchers need your help? Why can\'t computers do these tasks?**\nHumans are better than computers at many tasks. For most Zooniverse projects, computers just aren’t good enough to do the required task, or they may miss interesting features that a human would spot - this is why we need your help. Some Zooniverse projects are also using human classifications to help train computers to do better at these research tasks in the future. When you participate in a Zooniverse project, you are contributing to real research.',
      amIDoingThisRight: '- **How do I know if I\'m doing this right?**\nFor most of the subjects shown in Zooniverse projects, the researchers don\'t know the correct answer and that\'s why they need your help. Human beings are really good at pattern recognition tasks, so generally your first guess is likely the right one. Don’t worry too much about making an occasional mistake - more than one person will review each image, video or graph in a project. Most Zooniverse projects have a Help button, a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page, and a Field Guide with more information to guide you when classifying.',
      whatHappensToClassifications: '- **What happens to my classification after I submit it?**\nYour classifications are stored in the Zooniverse\'s secure online database. Later on a project\'s research team accesses and combines the multiple volunteer assessments stored for each subject, including your classifications, together. Once you have submitted your response for a given subject image, graph, or video, you can\'t go back and edit it. Further information can be found on the [Zooniverse User Agreement and Privacy Policy page](/privacy).',
      accountInformation: '- **What does the Zooniverse do with my account information?**\nThe Zooniverse takes very seriously the task of protecting our volunteer\'s personal information and classification data. Details about these efforts can be found on the [Zooniverse User Agreement and Privacy Policy page](/privacy) and the [Zooniverse Security page](/security).',
      featureRequest: '- **I have a feature request or found a bug; who should I talk to/how do I report it?**\nYou can post your suggestions for new features and report bugs via the [Zooniverse Talk](/talk) or through the [Zooniverse Software repository](https://github.com/zooniverse/Panoptes-Front-End/issues).',
      hiring: '- **Is the Zooniverse hiring?**\nThe Zooniverse is a collaboration between institutions from the United Kingdom and the United States; all of our team are employed by one or the other of these partner institutions. Check out the [Zoonvierse jobs page](https://jobs.zooniverse.org/) to find out more about employment opportunities within the Zooniverse.',
      howToAcknowledge: '- **I\'m a project owner/research team member, how do I acknowledge the Zooniverse and the Project Builder Platform in my paper, talk abstract, etc.?**\nYou can find more details on how to cite the Zooniverse in research publications using data derived from use of the Zooniverse Project Builder on our [Acknowledgements page](/about/acknowledgements).',

        header: '## Call for Zooniverse Audio Transcription Project Proposals',
        intro: 'Would your research benefit from the involvement of hundreds or even thousands of volunteers? Zooniverse.org is the world’s largest and most successful online platform for crowdsourced research. We currently have over 1.6 million registered volunteers working in collaboration with professional researchers on more than 70 research projects across a range of disciplines, from astronomy to biology, climatology to humanities subjects.',
        seekingProposals: 'Thanks to a generous grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, we are currently seeking proposals for two new custom audio transcription projects in the humanities or from GLAM institutions (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums), to be developed as part of the Zooniverse platform.',
        projectSelection: '### Project Selection',
        requirements: 'This call will be limited to research teams with audio recordings of spoken language (not limited to English) which would benefit from transcription into digital text formats and/or classification tasks like metadata tagging. We are particularly keen to work on projects where the resulting data can be incorporated into an existing content management system (CMS) and used for research purposes.',
        audioCompatibility: 'Audio compatibility is currently not available on our free [Project Builder](https://www.zooniverse.org/lab) tool. One aim of this effort will be to use these projects to help test and expand the functionality of our audio tools.',
        selectionCriteriaTitle: '### Selection Criteria',
        selectionCriteriaOne: '1. We are looking for projects that harness crowdsourced audio transcription for the purposes of unlocking data currently trapped in sources that cannot be transcribed through automation, and for which human effort is truly necessary. Therefore, proposals should address any previously-attempted methods of automated speech to text transcription.',
        selectionCriteriaTwo: '2. The data extracted must have an audience or usefulness, be this to academic researchers, members of the public or both.',
        selectionCriteriaThree: '3. Audio clips for transcription should feature one speaker at a time (per audio clip), as our current research effort does not include speaker diarization.',
        selectionCriteriaFour: '4. Project teams need clear plans for how to make the crowdsourced data openly and publicly available, ideally through a CMS or site hosted and maintained by your institution.',
        selectionCriteriaFive: '5. Audio material must be digitized; we do not have funds to support digitization of audio material.',
        selectionCriteriaSix: '6. We will not accept projects if the material for transcription has previously been edited or published as text.',
        furtherNotes: '### Further Notes',
        imlsGrantInfo: 'The two selected audio transcription projects will be part of an ongoing Zooniverse effort, [Transforming Libraries and Archives through Crowdsourcing](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-71-16-0028-16). We particularly welcome applications from marginalized or underrepresented groups, or which utilize content about or generated by underrepresented groups.',

      title: '## How to Volunteer',
      introduction: 'First of all, everyone who contributes to a Zooniverse project is a volunteer! We have a wonderful, global community who help us do what we do. The main ways of volunteering with us are helping us with classifications on data, being a beta tester on projects we\'ve yet to launch, and being a moderator for a project. For more information about any of these roles, just read below.',
      projectVolunteeringTitle: '### Volunteer on a Project',
      projectVolunteeringDescription: 'Volunteering on a project is the easiest and most common way of volunteering. We always need volunteers to go onto our projects and classify the data contained in them. You can read more about what happens with the classifications and how it helps the scientific community and the progress of science on the [About](/about) page.',
      projectLink: 'There is no minimum time requirement needed; do as much or as little as you\'d like. To get started as a classifications volunteer, just to go to the [Projects](/projects) page, have a look through, find one you like the look of, and get stuck in!',
      betaTesterTitle: '### Volunteer as a Beta Tester',
      betaTesterDescription: 'Volunteers also help us test projects before they are launched to check that they work properly. This involves working through some classifications on the beta project to check that it works, looking for any bugs, and filling out a questionnaire at the end. This helps us find any issues in the project that need resolving and also assess how suitable the project is for the Zooniverse. You can read some guidelines on what makes a project suitable on the [Policies](/lab-policies) page, under \'Rules and Regulations\'.',
      betaTesterSignUp: 'To sign up as a beta tester, go to [www.zooniverse.org/settings/email](/settings/email) and tick the box relating to beta testing.
