      summary: '## User Agreement\n**Summary**\n\nThe Zooniverse is a suite of citizen science projects operated by research groups in several institutions which support scientific research by involving members of the public - you - in the processes of analyzing and discussing data. Data from these projects is used to study online community design and theory, interface design, and other topics. This document describes what will happen to your contributions if you choose to contribute and what data we collect, how we use it and how we protect it.',
      contribution: '**What you agree to if you contribute to the Zooniverse**\n\nProjects involving the public are needed to enable researchers to cope with the otherwise unmanageable flood of data. The web provides a means of reaching a large audience willing to devote their free time to projects that can add to our knowledge of the world and the Universe.\n\nThe major goal for this project is for the analyzed data to be available to the researchers for use, modification and redistribution in order to further scientific research. Therefore, if you contribute to the Zooniverse, you grant us and our collaborators permission to use your contributions however we like to further this goal, trusting us to do the right thing with your data. However, you give us this permission non-exclusively, meaning that you yourself still own your contribution.\n\nWe ask you to grant us these broad permissions, because they allow us to change the legal details by which we keep the data available; this is important because the legal environment can change and we need to be able to respond without obtaining permission from every single contributor.\n\nFinally, you must not contribute data to the Zooniverse that you do not own. For example, do not copy information from published journal articles. If people do this, it can cause major legal headaches for us.',
      data: '**What you may do with Zooniverse data**\n\nYou retain ownership of any contribution you make to the Zooniverse, and any recorded interaction with the dataset associated with the Zooniverse. You may use, distribute or modify your individual contribution in any way you like. However, you do not possess ownership of the dataset itself. This license does not apply to data about you, covered in the Privacy Policy.',
      legal: '**Legal details**\n\nBy submitting your contribution to the Zooniverse, you agree to grant us a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sub-licensable license to: use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and exercise all copyright and publicity rights with respect to your contribution worldwide and/or to incorporate your contribution in other works in any media now known or later developed for the full term of any rights that may exist in your contribution.\n\nIf you do not want to grant to us the rights set out above, you cannot interact with the Zooniverse.\n\nBy interacting with the Zooniverse, you:\n\n* Warrant that your contribution contains only data that you have the right to make available to us for all the purposes specified above, is not defamatory, and does not infringe any law; and\n\n* Indemnify us against all legal fees, damages and other expenses that may be incurred by us as a result of your breach of the above warranty; and\n\n* Waive any moral rights in your contribution for the purposes specified above.\n\nThis license does not apply to data about you, covered in the Privacy Policy.'

      intro: '## Privacy Policy\n\nIn addition to the contributions you make towards the scientific goals of the Zooniverse, we collect additional data about you to support and improve the operation of the project. We also conduct experiments on the design of the website that we evaluate based on your reactions and behavior. This Privacy Policy describes what data we collect, how we use it and how we protect it.\n\nWe respect the privacy of every individual who participates in the Zooniverse. We operate in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and the Freedom of Information Act 2000, as well as with United Kingdom and United States regulations regarding protection of human subjects in research.',
      data: '**Data we collect**\n\n_Identifying information_: If you register with the Zooniverse, we ask you to create a username and supply your e-mail address. Your e-mail address is not visible to other users, but others will see your username in various contexts. Notably, your username is associated with any classifications or other contributions you make, including on comments submitted to Talk, the discussion forums hosted by the Zooniverse. You may optionally provide your real name to be included when we publically thank participants, e.g., in presentations, publications or discoveries.\n\n_Usage information_: We also monitor how people use our website, and aggregate general statistics about users and traffic patterns as well as data about how users respond to various site features. This includes, among other things, recording:\n\n* When you log in.\n\n* Pages you request.\n\n* Classifications you make.\n\n* Other contributions, such as posts on Talk pages.\n\nIf you register and log in, the logs associate these activities with your username. Otherwise, they are solely associated with your IP address. In order to collect this data, we may use software such as Google Analytics that collects statistics from IP data. This software can determine what times of day people access our site, which country they access the websites from, how long they visit for, along with technical details of their computer (browser, screen type, processor).',

      cookies: '**How we use cookies**\n\nIn some areas of our site, a cookie might be placed on your computer. A cookie is a small file that resides on your computer\'s hard drive that allows us to improve the quality of your visit to our websites by responding to you as an individual.\n\nWe use cookies to identify which pages are being used and improve our website. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes, they are not shared with other sites and are not used for advertisements.\n\nYou can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. However, if you choose to decline cookies from the Zooniverse then functionality, including your ability to log-in and participate, will be impaired.\n\nAcceptance of cookies is implied if you continue to access our website without adjusting your browser settings.',
      dataStorage: '**Where we store your data**\n\nWe use Amazon Web Services so we can quickly and reliably serve our website to an unpredictable number of people. This means that your data will be stored in multiple locations, including the United States of America (USA). Amazon is a participant in the Privacy Shield program developed by the USA Department of Commerce and the European Union (EU). \n\nOur mailing list server, which contains a copy of subscribed email addresses and no other personal data, is hosted on a virtual private server with Linode in the UK.',
      security: '**Security measures**\n\nMembers of the research teams are made aware of our privacy policy and practices by reviewing this statement upon joining the team. We follow industry best practices to secure user data, and access to the database and logs are limited to members of the research group and system administrative staff.',
      dataRemoval: '**Removing your data**\n\nDue to the way in which we archive data, it is generally not possible to completely remove your personal data from our systems. However, if you have specific concerns, please contact us and we will see what we can do.',
      contactUser: '**When we will contact you**\n\nIf you do not register, we will never contact you. If you do register, we will contact you by e-mail in the following circumstances:\n\n* Occasionally, we will send e-mail messages to you highlighting a particular aspect of our research, announcing new features, explaining changes to the system, or inviting you to special events.\n\n* We might also use your email to contact you for the purpose of research into our site\'s operation, and we might ask for additional information at that time. Any additional information will be held consitently with this policy, and participation in such studies is entirely optional and participating or otherwise will in no way affect your use of the site.\n\n* We might contact you with a newsletter about the progress of the project.\n\nYou can \'opt out\' of communications from any project or from the Zooniverse as a whole at any time by visiting the Zooniverse [unsubscribe](https://www.zooniverse.org/unsubscribe) page.',

      whatIsZooniverse: 'Das Zooniverse ist die weltgrößte und populärste Plattform für personen-getriebene Forschung. Diese Forschung ist nur möglich, weil Freiwillige — mehr als eine Million Menschen aus aller Welt - zusammenkommen, um professionellen Wissenschaftlern zu helfen. Unser Ziel ist es Forschung zu ermöglichen, die sonst nicht durchführbar oder praktisch wäre. Zooniverse Forschung resultiert in neuen Entdeckungen, Datensätzen mit Bedeutung für das größere Forschungsumfeld und [vielen wissenschaftlichen Publikationen](/about/publications).',
      anyoneCanResearch: '### Bei Zooniverse kann jeder forschen.\n\nDu brauchst keinen spezialisierten Hintergrund, Training oder Expertise zur Teilnahme an einem Zooniverse Projekt. Wir machen es einfach für jeden zu realer akademischen Forschung am eigenen Computer und von überallher beizutragen.\n\nDu hast die Möglichkeit, authentische Objekte, die für Forscher von Interesse sind, wie Bilder von weitentfernten Galaxien, historische Berichte und Tagebücher oder Videos von Tieren in ihrem natürlichen Umfeld zu studieren. Mit der Beantwortung von einfachen Fragen kannst Du zu unserem Verständnis unserer Welt, unserer Geschichte, unseres Universums und mehr beitragen.\n\nMit unserer weiten und ständig steigenden Auswahl an Projekten in vielen Disziplinen und zu verschiedenen Themen in den Natur- und Geisteswissenschaften gibt es einen Platz für alle und jeden, um zu erkunden, zu lernen und Spaß im Zooniverse zu haben. Um hier mitzumachen, gehe einfach zu [Projekte](/projects), wähle eines aus, was Dir gefällt, und fang an!',
      accelerateResearch: '### Wir beschleunigen Forschung durch Zusammenarbeit.\n\nDie wichtigste Herausforderung des 21. Jahrhunderts ist es, mit der Flut an Informationen umzugehen, die heutzutage über die Welt um uns herum gesammelt werden kann. Computer können helfen, aber in vielen Feldern ist die Fähigkeit des Menschen Muster zu erkennen — und unsere Fähigkeit überrascht zu werden — diesen überlegen. Mit der Hilfe von Freiwilligen im Zooniverse können Wissenschaftler ihre Informationen schneller und genauer als sonst möglich analysieren. Dies spart Zeit und Ressourcen, verbessert die Fähigkeiten von Computern dieselben Aufgaben zu machen und führt zu schnellerem Fortschritt, einem besseren Verständnis der Welt und schneller vorhandenen Ergebnissen.\n\nUnsere Projekte vereinen die Beiträge vieler einzelner Freiwilliger und vertraut auf eine Version der "Weisheit der Masse", um zuverlässige und exakte Daten zu produzieren. Dadurch dass viele Personen auf die Daten schauen, können wir oft auch abschätzen wie wahrscheinlich es ist, dass wir einen Fehler machen. Das Ergebnis eines Zooniverse Projekts ist oftmals genau das, was gebraucht wird, um Fortschritt in vielen Forschungsfeldern zu erzielen.',
      discoveries: '### Freiwillige und Experten machen zusammen echte Entdeckungen.\n\nZooniverse Projekte sind konstruiert mit dem Ziel, das Engagement von Freiwilligen in messbare Ergebnisse zu übertragen. Die Projekte haben bereits eine große Anzahl von [wissenschaftlichen Veröffentlichungen](/about/publications) und mehrere offene Sätze analysierter Daten produziert. In einigen Fällen haben Freiwillige bei Zooniverse völlig unerwartete und wissenschaftlich signifikante Entdeckungen gemacht.\n\nEin signifikanter Anteil dieser Forschung findet auf den Zooniverse Diskussionsforen statt, wo Freiwillige miteinander und mit den Forscherteams zusammenarbeiten können. Diese Foren sind in jedes Projekt integriert, um vom schnellen Hashtag und Kommentar bis zur gründlichen kollaborativen Analyse alles zu erlauben. Es gibt zudem ein zentrales Zooniverse Forum für allgemeine Unterhaltungen und die Diskussion Zooniverse-übergreifender Angelegenheiten.\n\nViele der interessantesten Entdeckungen von Zooniverse Projekten entstehen in Diskussionen zwischen Freiwilligen und Forschern. Wir ermutigen alle Nutzer sich für eine intensive Teilnahme in die Diskussionsforen einzubringen.'
