# Subject Group Comparison Task

The Subject Group Comparison Task in PFE is an ADMIN-ONLY component. The code in this folder exists only to allow admins to edit SGC Tasks.

When a volunter views an SGC Task on the PFE Classifier, the task is purely a placeholder.

For a volunteer to properly view an SGC Task, they have to do so on the [FEM](https://github.com/zooniverse/front-end-monorepo) Classifier.
