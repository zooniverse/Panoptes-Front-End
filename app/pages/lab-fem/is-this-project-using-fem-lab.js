/**
This function is used to determine if a Zooniverse project should be using
the FEM-compatible (Front-End-Monorepo) version of the Project Builder (Lab).

More FEM-lab code can be found in app/pages/lab-fem

Context: this code was created during the 2020/2021 transitory period where
we're migrating _some_ (but not _all_ ) projects to use FEM.

Please see the associated /app/monorepoUtils.js , /app/MonorepoRoute.jsx,
and /app/MonorepoRoutes.jsx code, which use separate checks to determine if the
project should use the **FEM Classifier + project page.**
