      The Zooniverse takes very seriously the security of our websites and systems, and protecting our users and their personal information is our highest priority.

      * Do not use the same password on different websites. The password you use for your Zooniverse account should be unique to us.
      * Never give your password to anyone. We will never ask you to send us your password, and you should never enter your Zooniverse password into any website other than ours. Always check your browser's address bar to make sure you have a secure connection to _www.zooniverse.org_.
