        <p>The mini-course is an educational tool used to improve quality of classifications and retain volunteer interest through presenting information on the tips & tricks of quality classification, the research process, and the team behind your project.</p>
        <p>Some things to know: The mini-course will interrupt the volunteer based on the set frequency. If the frequency is a single whole number, then the mini-course will appear every N classifications. If it is a comma-separated list of whole numbers, then the mini-course will appear when the classification count for that session equals one of the whole numbers in order. If the frequency is left blank, then a default frequency of five will be used. The volunteer will always be given the option to opt out. If you need to add a caption to an image, especially for credit, then include <pre><code>###### example caption text</code></pre> at the start of your text. You can reorder the steps by clicking and dragging on the left gray tab. It is important to keep each step brief so volunteers can get back to classifying as soon as possible!</p>
        <p><strong>Mini-courses should be linked to a workflow on its workflow editor page to pop up for your project.</strong></p>
