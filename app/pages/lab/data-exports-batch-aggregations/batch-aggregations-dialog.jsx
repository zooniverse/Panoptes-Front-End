/*
Batch Aggregations Dialog/Modal
The part of the Batch Aggregations Data Export feature that lets users request
new aggregations for any workflow on the project. 

Divided into 3 steps for the user:
1. select workflow (that has a valid workflow classifications export)
2. confirm that the workflows export exists.
3. request a new batch aggregation data export for the selected workflow (if one
   doesn't already exist).

Component Props:
- closeModal: callback function when the modal's Close button is clicked.
  Usually it's just the parent component calling htmlDialogElement.close()
- project: the project whose workflows we want to list. (Panoptes Project
  Resource)
- user: currently logged-in user. (Panoptes User Resource)
