        <p>The project tutorial is a step-by-step introduction to the project's interface.</p>
        <p>This is the place to give the volunteers a preview of the data they'll be working with and of the steps they'll be taking to make classifications. It's also a good place to mention any common "gotchas" users might face.</p>
        <p>However, it's also important to keep this as short as possible so volunteers can get started classifying as soon as possible!</p>
        <p><strong>Tutorials should be linked to a workflow on its workflow editor page to pop up for your project.</strong></p>
        <p> <strong> You can reorder the steps in your tutorial by clicking and dragging on the left gray tab </strong> </p>
