# Icons for the Pages Editor

Icons are organised into this folder, to make them easier should we choose to update them in the future - e.g. replace all FontAwesome icons with Grommet icons or custom SVGs.

Notes:
- Eventually, the `TaskIcon` and `DrawingToolIcon` can and should be adjusted to pull from the icons in the FEM code base.
